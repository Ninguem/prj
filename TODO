* DONE Start prj project.

* DONE Share.
GitHub.

* DONE Start a true open development process...
Never stop improving on it.

* DONE Fix usability bug in st) verb: No need to show the name of each projects twice.
Since printing the projects description already prints its name...

* DONE Another bug in st) verb: name of categories containing an "a" will be printed simply "a".
Cannot make sense of why. At all!
Maybe it has to do with this:
$ echo [bcde]
[bcde]
$ echo [abcde]
a
$ echo [bcade]
a
:-/

* DONE Fix the iframe in the homepage.
It's trully bad design.

* DONE Now that the site is up, simplify the README file.
Some information, like the examples, don't really belong in there.
Also, some information might not be coincident.

* DONE Comment the code a little bit more.
The configuration portion is fine, but the main portion is in need of some attention.

* DONE Bug in do) verb: when using the do) verb, git complains.
fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git
The runshell() function was not doing wht it was supposed to do: the alias to exit was checking git status when starting the shell, not at exit time.
The error would be fixed by adding --work-tree="$workingcategorydir"/"$1" to git status command. But would not fix the previously mentioned issue. So let's just remove the functionality for now until a real solution is found.

* DONE Found and fixed a bug in todo) verb.
Forgot to exit with help message if no argument was given or was given a wrong number of arguments.

* DONE The status verb should display projects tasks, just like it displays the projects scripts or dependencies.
Like so:
Task: Do this.
Task: Do that.
It should also print out sub-tasks. This can be achieved with a regex like the following for grep:
grep ^'*\+\ TODO' $projectsdirectory/TODO
Capturing one or more "*" followed by " TODO" in the beginning of a sentance.
Although... Why list subtasks if parent task is unfinished anyway?... Decided to list only main tasks!

* DONE Create an icon.
Stick it on the webpage.
Create the favicon.ico. Aply it.
Done! It's not the best favicon ever, but lets use it untill something better comes along.

* DONE Bug in done) verb: if compression fails, it still removes the uncompressed project!
The user looses data!
Dangerous!
Well... this is embarrassing! I could not reproduce the bug.
Tested with a small filesystem and all seems to be working correctly.
Let's consider it "done" until proven otherwise.

* DONE Reinvent the wheel: Some concepts need to be revised.
There is no need for the notion of a "working category".
The user's working directory (~, $XDG_DESKTOP_DIR or other) should contain "pointers" (links) to the directories of the projects stored on the directories of the categories they are on.
This might not be ideal since the user might pollute the "working directory" with stuff that cannot later be dealt with by the script like temporary work or downloads or whatever... Maybe we could deal with those later.

* TODO The wheel has been reinvented. Now it is time to test it.
See if the script behaves appropriately and fix any issues.
