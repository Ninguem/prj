* DONE Start prj project.

* DONE Share.
GitHub.

* DONE Start a true open development process...
Never stop improving on it.

* DONE Fix usability bug in st) verb: No need to show the name of each projects twice.
Since printing the projects description already prints its name...

* DONE Another bug in st) verb: name of categories containing an "a" will be printed simply "a".
Cannot make sense of why. At all!
Maybe it has to do with this:
$ echo [bcde]
[bcde]
$ echo [abcde]
a
$ echo [bcade]
a
:-/

* DONE Fix the iframe in the homepage.
It's trully bad design.

* DONE Now that the site is up, simplify the README file.
Some information, like the examples, don't really belong in there.
Also, some information might not be coincident.

* TODO Create an icon.
Stick it on the webpage.
Create the favicon.ico. Aply it.

* TODO The status verb should display project's tasks, just like it displays the project's scripts or dependencies.
Like so:
Task: Do this.
Task: Do that.
It should also print out sub-tasks. This can be achieved with a regex like the following for grep:
grep ^'*\+\ TODO' $projectsdirectory/TODO
Capturing one or more "*" followed by " TODO" in the beginning of a sentance.
